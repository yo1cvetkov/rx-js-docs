# Types of observables

## Hot and Cold Observables

**Cold** observables are observables that emit some values during some interval when we subscribe to them. Sometimes immediately, sometimes with a time delay. All of these observables produce values independently for each subscription.

Cold observables can also emit different values for each subscription. We can say that observable is **cold** when it produces the source of the data inside of the observable's logic.

If we make three separate subscriptions to the same observable (some API call e.g.) each subscription will receive it's own data.

```typescript
import { ajax } from "rxjs/ajax";

const ajax$ = ajax<any>("http://someapiurl.com/api/names");

ajax$.subscribe((data) => console.log(data));
ajax$.subscribe((data) => console.log(data));
ajax$.subscribe((data) => console.log(data));
```

Each of these subscriptions will receive its own even that it is subscribing to the same observable which calls the same endpoint.

**Hot** observables are observables where all the subscriptions share same source of data. This is done so that observable connects to something that is already existing source. For example, DOM events.
This means if we subscribe to the same event three times all the three subscriptions will receive the same data emited by the same data source subscribed to the DOM event.
When the specific event is triggered inside the observable, all the subscriptions will be notified that event has happened. Source works independently on the observable and every new connection will be subscription to the same source.

```typescript
const helloButton = document.querySelector("button#hello");

const helloClicks$ = new Observable<MouseEvent>((subscriber) => {
  helloButton.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    subscriber.next(event);
  });
});

helloClicks$.subscribe((value) => console.log(value));
helloClicks$.subscribe((value) => console.log("Second sub", value));
```

This way, both subscriptions will log the same event to the console even though they are different subscriptions in essence.

Hot observables are also defined as the observables that just wrap around some existing event emitter like the DOM events are.
Also if we delay the subscribing to the specific observable it means that it will attach the observer after that time and after that it will be able to react to the specific notifications.

**Hot vs Cold** observables

COLD -> Produces data inside -> new subscriber - new data

HOT -> Multicasts data from a common source -> new subscriber - same data
