# Fundamentals of RxJS

## Array vs Stream

What is a stream ? Observables are based around the concept of streams. This idea means that different parts of data comes at different times and theoretically this source of data could be infinite.

The opposite of this approach is when items are processed one at a time. Most of us are familiar with arrays in which most of the data is already known and available to us. On the other side, in obaservables this is not the case and we have to think about it a stream-like way.

**Arrays**

In arrays we have access immeadiately to all of the items inside, so that we know immeadiately how many of them is available and what are these items.

The thing about arrays is that we know which are the items in the array and which value is at specific index in the array.

**Stream**

Items in streams can come in various points of time. So imagine that some stream of values come at different points in time and for example, first comes item number 1 and we see it and we are defining how we react to it. Then comes the second item in the stream - item number 2 and then we also react on it somehow.

This concept is called _reactive programming_ and Observables are based on this concept.

## Observable

It is simple concept of the callback function which will emit some data based on different kinds of notifications.
There are 3 main types of notifications inside the `Observable`.

These are: `next` , `error` and `complete`.

Let's focus on `next` notifications which allow us to emit values.
As we saw previously, we create new `Observable` by using the constructor with the same name:

```typescript
const someObservable$ = new Observable((subscriber) => {
  subscriber.next("Alice");
  subscriber.next("Bob");
});
```

The question is, what is the `subscriber` object ?

In order to understande let's look at some other types in RxJS.

`Observer` object :

```typescript
const observer = {
  next: (value) => console.log(value),
};
```

The `next` callback function defined in the Observer provides the behavior for the `next` notification in the `Observable`.

How do we connect our Observer to the Observable that we have above ? The answer is the `Subscription`. Subscription is what executes the Observable. It runs the function inside the Observable and passes it the function from the Observer.

```typescript
someObservable$.subscribe(observer);
```

This is how we do this. Now each time the `next` function is executed, it calls the `next` callback inside the observer and the body of this callback is executed.

It is also important that the subscription that is done, we need to close or unsubscribe so that we don't cause any other side-effects or memory leaks inside our app.

This can be done using the `unsubscribe()` method on the subscription. We can get the reference to the `subscription` object when the `subscribe` method is called and it returns the `subscription` object.

**What will happen if we call the subscribe on the same Observable multiple times ?**

What will happen if we subscribe again to the same subscription and same observer. In this case, new subscription will be created, and it will call the same functions and produce the same output independently to the first subscription. If we on the other hand provide different observer to the same observable it will again create another subscription which will behave in other manner defined in the new observer.

Let's see what will happen in this situation where we have two subscriptions that will subscribe at different points in time:

```typescript
const someObservable$ = new Observable<string>((subscriber) => {
  subscriber.next("Alice");

  setTimeout(() => {
    subscriber.next("Bob");
  }, 2000);

  setTimeout(() => {
    subscriber.next("Charlie", 4000);
  });
});
```

Then we subscribe at different points in time

```typescript
someObservable$.subscribe((value) => console.log(value));

setTimeout(() => {
  someObservable$.subscribe((value) => console.log("Second sub", value));
}, 1000);
```

The execution order will be

`Alice`
`Second sub Alice`
`Bob`
`Second sub Bob`
`Charlie`
`Second sub Charlie`

This represents that in case of multiple subscriptions, each code for the specific subscription will be called independently of the other.

### Notification types

_next_ notification type - can be emitted 0 to many times

_error_ notification type - can be emitted only once

_complete_ notification type - can be emitted only once

Also there should be no emitted notifications after an error or complete notification. Also, once the error or complete are emitted the subscription is closed.
