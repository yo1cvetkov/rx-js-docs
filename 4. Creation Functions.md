# Creation Functions inside RxJS

**Creation functions** provide us with the observable creation using the shorter syntax to create some familiar behavior.
We already saw the `ajax` function which enables us to create Observable by making the HTTP calls.

## `of` creation function

It allows us to create observable that emits a set of values and completes. So as we subscribe to this observable, all the passed (provided) values will be emitted as the next notifications and it will complete, ending the subscription.

For example, we can define something like this:

```typescript
of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie").subscribe((value) => console.log(value));
```

This will emit all the passed values one by one and complete.

Under the hood, recreating this function can look something like this:

```typescript
function of(...args: string[]): Observable<string> {
  return new Observable((subscriber) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < args.length; i++) {
      subscriber.next(args[i]);
    }

    subscriber.complete();
  });
}
```

## `from` creation types

Used to create other types into an Observable. We can pass it an array of values or another popular way is to create observable of Promise. Once we subscribe to this kind of observable the resolved Promise value will be emitted as the next notification value.

So `from` can be used to create observable of the values inside an array:

```typescript
from(["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]).subscribe((value) => console.log(value));
```

Or, it can be used to create observable from `Promise` type

```typescript
const somePromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve("Resolved!");
});

from(somePromise).subscribe((value) => console.log(value));
```

This way we converted promise into an observable and the from will emit the next inside which will call the `.then` and return the resolved value.

## `fromEvent` creation types

Used to wrap event inside an Observable. We can pass it an element and an event and by subscribing, under the hood, RxJS will call the `addEventListener` while unsubscribing will call the `removeEventListener`.

This will look something like:

```typescript
const triggerButton = document.querySelector("button#trigger");

fromEvent<MouseEvent>(triggerButton, "click").subscribe((event) => console.log(event));
```

And it is something similar to doing this:

```typescript
const triggerClick$ = new Observable<MouseEvent>((subscriber) => {
  triggerButton.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    subscriber.next(event);
  });
});

triggerClick$.subscribe((event) => console.log(event));
```

After we unsubscribe from the subscription created by `fromEvent` it will remove the event listener.

But in our case of creating the `triggerClick` manually inside the observer, that won't be the case since on the teardown we don't remove the listener.
