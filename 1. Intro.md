# Introduction to RxJS

**RxJS** is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. The core type - `Observable`, satellite types and other operators inspired by `Array` methods to allow handling of async events as collections.

It combines _Observer pattern_ with the _Iterator_ pattern and functional programming with collections to fill the need for an ideal way of managing sequences of events.

Essential concepts in RxJs:

1. **Observable** - invokable collection of future values or events.

2. **Observer** - collection of callbacks that knows how to listen to values delievered by the Observable.

3. **Subscription** - represents the execution of an Observable, primarily useful for cancelling the execution.

4. **Operators** - pure functions that enable a functional programming style of dealing with collections with operations like `map`, `filter`, `concat`, `reduce`, etc.

5. **Subject** - it is equivalent to the `EventEmitter` and only way of multicasting a value or event to multiple Observers.

6. **Schedulers** - centralized dispatchers to control concurrency, allowing us to coordinate when computation happens e.g. `setTimeout` and `requestAnimationFrame` or others.

## Overview

RxJS - Reactive Extensions for Javascript

Observable in simple words is just some function which emits some value when we subscribe to it.

When dealing with observables, common practice is to use `$` at the end of the observable name, and then we will easily spot the observable inside our code.

We invoke the observable by _subscribing_ to it using the `subscribe()` method.
But by just invoking we are not exactly specifying what happens with the values emited by the observable. So we need to provide some callback inside the subscribe method do define how these values are actually handled.

Let's say we have the following simple `Observable`.

```typescript
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

const someObservable$ = new Observable<string>((subscriber) => {
  subscriber.next("alice");
  subscriber.next("bob");
  subscriber.next("john");
  subscriber.complete();
});
```

Ignore the body of the observable callback, we just need to know that this observable emits some names after we subscribe to it.

```typescript
someObservable$.subscribe((value) => console.log(value));
```

This way we subscribed to that observable and we need to console log each of the values emitted by the observable. This way we specify what happens with the values emitted by the observable.

Even if we have another example, of storing some data on the server, we can have some observable like:

```typescript
storeDataOnServer("some value");
```

and let's pretend that this is an Observable which has some logic inside for storing the data on the server. Actually just by running it like this, we won't do much. In order to execute the logic inside this Observable we need to call the `subscribe` method on it.

```typescript
storeDataOnServer("some value").subscribe();
```

This way we execute logic inside the observable where we provide it some value that will be stored. Also if this Observable after doing some async work of storing data, emits some event or data we can also decide what to do with it by specifying the callback function inside the `subscribe()` method.

Also, it can be handled in different ways based on notifications the observer returns. For example if some error occurs inside the Observer we can define what will happen in that case:

```typescript
storeDataOnServer("some value").subscribe({
  next: (value) => console.log(value),
  error: (error) => console.log(error),
});
```

This way, for each notification, we specify what happens with the data emitted by observable.
